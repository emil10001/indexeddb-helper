This is a wrapper library for IndexedDB. It's very basic, definitely not production ready. This is really intended to be a learning exercise to learn the basics of IndexedDB. Also, IndexedDB seems to be a fairly verbose API, so I wanted to have a wrapper that would abstract out some of the redundant parts for me.
